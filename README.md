# nba_impact_stats
The idea for impact statistics is to look only at the impact a player has on the scoring of a team, compared to the opponent.
The impact of a player is determined by the scoring difference while that player is on the court. Because this looks solely at the scoring difference, it catches both defensive and offensive impact of the player.
